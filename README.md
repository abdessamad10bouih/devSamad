# AI-Driven Personalized Recommendation System

## 1. Project Title and Description

This repository contains an AI-driven personalized recommendation system designed to suggest relevant items to users based on their past interactions and preferences. The system leverages machine learning models, specifically collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, to generate accurate and personalized recommendations. The backend is built using Python with the FastAPI framework, offering a RESTful API for seamless integration with front-end applications. Data is stored and managed using a PostgreSQL database, and the system incorporates Celery for asynchronous task processing, such as model training and data updates. The project also includes comprehensive unit and integration tests, as well as a Dockerfile for containerization and deployment.

## 2. Key Features

*   **Personalized Recommendations:** Delivers item recommendations tailored to individual user preferences.
*   **Collaborative Filtering:** Uses user-item interaction data to identify users with similar tastes and recommend items liked by them.
*   **Content-Based Filtering:** Leverages item metadata (e.g., descriptions, categories) to recommend items similar to those a user has liked in the past.
*   **RESTful API:** Provides a well-defined API built with FastAPI for easy integration with front-end applications.
*   **Asynchronous Task Processing:** Uses Celery to handle computationally intensive tasks, such as model training, without blocking API requests.

## 4. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[your_username]/recommendation-system.git
    cd recommendation-system
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up the database:**

    *   Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running.
    *   Create a database named `recommendation_db` (or configure the database name in `app/core/config.py`).
    *   Update the database connection URL in `app/core/config.py` to reflect your PostgreSQL credentials. Example: `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database_name`

5. **Configure Environment Variables:**

    *   Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` and set the necessary environment variables such as `DATABASE_URL`, `CELERY_BROKER_URL`, and `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND`. These are crucial for the application to connect to the database and Celery broker.

## 5. Usage

1.  **Start the application:**

    ```bash
    ./start.sh
    ```

    This script starts the FastAPI application using Uvicorn and the Celery worker.

2.  **Access the API:**

    The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.  You can access the automatically generated Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8000/docs` for API documentation and testing.

3.  **Example API requests:**

    *   **Get all users:** `GET /users`
    *   **Get a specific user:** `GET /users/{user_id}`
    *   **Get all items:** `GET /items`
    *   **Get recommendations for a user:** `GET /users/{user_id}/recommendations`

## 6. Configuration

The application is configured using environment variables defined in `app/core/config.py`.  Important configuration parameters include:

*   **`DATABASE_URL`:** The URL of the PostgreSQL database.
*   **`CELERY_BROKER_URL`:** The URL of the Celery broker (e.g., Redis or RabbitMQ).
*   **`CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND`:** The URL of the Celery result backend.
*   **`API_VERSION`:** The API version.
*   **`PROJECT_NAME`:** The name of the project.

These variables are loaded from the environment using Pydantic's `BaseSettings`. You can set these variables in a `.env` file or directly in your environment.

## 7. Architecture / Design Decisions

*   **FastAPI:** Chosen for its speed, ease of use, automatic data validation, and built-in API documentation (Swagger UI).  This simplifies API development and maintenance.
*   **PostgreSQL:** Selected for its reliability, ACID compliance, and support for advanced features like JSONB data type, which can be useful for storing item metadata.
*   **Celery:** Used to handle asynchronous tasks, such as model training, which can be computationally intensive and time-consuming.  This prevents blocking the main API thread and ensures responsiveness.
*   **Collaborative Filtering & Content-Based Filtering:** These algorithms were selected for their effectiveness in generating personalized recommendations. The system is designed to allow for the addition of other recommendation algorithms in the future.
*   **Docker:** Containerization with Docker ensures consistency across different environments and simplifies deployment.
*   **Pydantic:** For request/response model validation and settings management.
*   **SQLAlchemy:** For ORM and database interactions.

The design prioritizes modularity, scalability, and maintainability. The use of service layers separates business logic from the API layer, making the code easier to test and modify.  Asynchronous task processing with Celery ensures that the API remains responsive even when handling computationally intensive tasks.
